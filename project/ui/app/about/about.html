I moved to Bangalore in November 2015 after my wedding. Riding high on the newness of everything around my interest in food ( just the cooking part actually) led me to experiment with known and less known cuisines. Thanks to my friends who happily ( and I presume unknowingly) gave into being the guinea pigs :P. It was later when the compliments changes into recipe exchanging conversations and then into analysis of reasons for good taste. Turns out it wasn't only my "devotion" to cooking but the finer ingredients.. The spices and condiments that took away the credit. Transcending the boundaries of the house my colleagues also confirmed that despite same recipes the food tasted better due to the "magic" masalas.  Well I thought back and realises that this could be the seal breaker as I do not get my masalas from the market here. My mom-in-law ( a veteran cook)  curates them from different places and packs it for me.

  So on insistence and a bit persistence from friends around I decided to share it with all those who look for ways to charm the guests and family with a pinch of magic.. To let the chef within dance away to the tune of " waah" and " maza aa gaya" at every meal.

  Hope you also enjoy the mewas and the masalas here  with every bite.
