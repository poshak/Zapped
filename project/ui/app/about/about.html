    "I moved to Bangalore in November 2014 after my wedding. Riding high on the newness of everything around, my interest in food (just the cooking part actually) led me to experiment with known and less known cuisines. Thanks to my friends who happily ( and I presume unknowingly) gave into being the guinea pigs :P.
  <br><br>
    Gradually the compliments evolved into recipe exchanges and later into analysis of the reason for good taste. Turns out it wasn't only my ""devotion"" to cooking but the finer ingredients; the ""magic masalas"" that took away the credit. Well yes, I do not get my masalas from the local Bangalore market; my mom-in-law (a veteran cook) curates them from different places and packs it for me instead.
    <br><br>
    So on insistence from friends, I decided to share it with all those who look for ways to charm the guests and family with a pinch of magic; to let the chef within them dance away to the tune of "" waah"" and "" maza aa gaya"" at every meal.
    <br><br>
    Hope you also enjoy the mewas and the masalas here with every bite.
